```

- `build` - contains the Singularity definition files for building the container and the apt file with the dependencies. If you want to add new dependencies, you have to add them to the apt file.
- `commands` - contains the scripts that are used in the container. The scripts are used to build the workspace, start the IDEs, and source the workspace.
- `images` - contains the built or downloaded Singularity images.
- `logs` - contains the logs from building the container.
- `scripts` - contains the scripts for building, downloading, starting, and uploading the Singularity container. Each script has a `help` option that shows the usage of the script. You can run the script with the `help` option by running the script with the `-h` or `--help` option.

## How to use

### Using the container

To use the container, first you have to download it. You can do it by running the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/download_image.sh
```

This will download the singularity image to the `images` directory.

Then, you can run the container by running the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/start_singularity.sh
```

This will start the container, and you will be able to use the RoboTour project.

### Building the container

If you want to build the container, you can do it by running the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/build_image.sh
```

This will build the singularity image and save it to the `images` directory. Next you have to upload it to the server.

```bash
bash scripts/upload_image.sh
```
